# Simplifying Asynchronous Code in C# with Design Patterns
# .NET Strategies to Simplify Asynchronous Code in C#: The Journey from Nested Callbacks to Elegant Solutions

## Introduction

This repository contains examples and code snippets discussed in the article [.NET Strategies with Advanced Iteration Techniques for C# Collections](https://fnbk.medium.com/net-strategies-to-simplify-asynchronous-code-in-c-be28a88cbea1). The article provides insights into handling complex asynchronous code paths in C# by employing various .NET features and design patterns.

## Code Examples

The examples showcase the evolution of a basic asynchronous process in a .NET application, starting from nested callbacks to more elegant solutions using advanced .NET features and patterns.

### Nested Callbacks Problem

Initially, we have a method `CompleteOrderProcessAsync` which is an example of the problematic, deeply nested callbacks approach.

### Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)

Code for refactoring the initial example using the `async` and `await` keywords to create a linear, more readable asynchronous process using TAP.

### Task Parallel Library (TPL) Dataflow

Examples using TPL Dataflow to create an assembly line of tasks which processes orders in a more declarative and clear way.

### Reactive Extensions (Rx)

Illustration of converting the asynchronous process into observable sequences with Reactive Extensions, improving flow control and error handling.

### Event Aggregator Pattern

An Event Aggregator is introduced to manage event-driven asynchronous processes, showcasing how publishers and subscribers can interact without tightly coupled references.

## Getting Started

To try these code examples:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Understand the initial tangled callback example in the `CompleteOrderProcessAsync` method.
4. Explore how each subsequent refactor improves the structure and maintainability.
5. Run examples and observe the output for each pattern.


## Conclusion

Through this series of examples, developers can learn to optimize asynchronous processes in C#, navigating away from "Callback Hell" towards clear, maintainable, and scalable code.

This guide anticipates that readers will have previously explored advanced iteration techniques for C# collections, as covered in the previous article in the series, [.NET Strategies with Advanced Iteration Techniques for C# Collections](https://fnbk.medium.com/net-strategies-to-simplify-asynchronous-code-in-c-be28a88cbea1).
